          "race_comment_alternative":"BOBDATORTOISE (3) has gone well at his last couple of runs here, most recently when second beaten 5 lengths (24.61). Well placed and gets his chance. LACKEN FIZZ (6) struggled to get involved last start after drifting back at this track, but prior to that won by 1.5 lengths at this track (24.46) beating Fabulous Magique in an A6 on March 22. Warrants plenty of respect. DINNER CHARLIE (4) was safely held last time out, finishing sixth at this track over 400m behind Petroma Cayson (25.28) in an A4. Can figure in the finish. FRAINEY BORDEAUX (5) stalked the lead after a clean break from trap 4 and went on to finish second (24.58) at this track in an A4 over 400m. Expected to feature in the finish again."
