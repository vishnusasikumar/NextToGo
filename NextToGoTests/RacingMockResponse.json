Should be able to push forward again from another nice draw. Major player again. VILLAGE AREA (1) was in the money at Junee starts runs ago then took no competitive part after bombing the start last time. Should enjoy an economical run from this draw. Contender with manners. YANKEE BABE (10) should be at her peak for this. Finished third at Wagga at the latest appearance a week-and-a-half ago. Can give the top fancies plenty to think about. THE IRISHMAN NZ (9) hasn't featured at his last couple but kicked off the campaign with back-to-back placings so can do better."
